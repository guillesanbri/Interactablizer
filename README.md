# Interactablizer
VRTK4 Tool to convert objects into interactable objets.

To use the tool, simply drop the script and the .meta in your project.
This should go in a folder named Editor in order to avoid including it in the build.
If you donÂ´t import the .meta file, you may need to set the interactables prefabs.

Keep in mind this is WIP and altough it is functional, it is expected to allow further configuration in a few days.
